// It is easy to join two strings together like this string1 + string2.

// Another way to get the desired result would be with string1.concat(string2)

// ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.

// + , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!

// If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.

function joinStrings(string1, string2){
    return `${string1} ${string2}`
  }
  console.log(joinStrings('string1', 'string2'), 'string1 string2')
  console.log(joinStrings('testing', 'testing'), 'testing testing')
  console.log(joinStrings(134, 234), '134 234')
