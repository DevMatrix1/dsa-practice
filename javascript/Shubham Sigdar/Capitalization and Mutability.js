// Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string (that contains a single word)
// before they went on vacation.

// Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work. 
// Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. make the first character in the string "word" upper case).

// Don't worry about numbers, special characters, or non-string types being passed to the function. 
// The string lengths will be from 1 character up to 10 characters, but will never be empty.

function capitalizeWord(word) {
    return word[0].toUpperCase()+word.slice(1);
    
  }
  console.log(capitalizeWord('word'), 'Word')
  console.log(capitalizeWord('i'), 'I')
  console.log(capitalizeWord('glasswear'), 'Glasswear')
