// Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

// This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

// This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

// 100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
// 90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
// 75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
// 0, in other cases
