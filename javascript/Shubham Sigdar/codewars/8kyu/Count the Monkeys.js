// You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

// As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

// For example(Input --> Output):

// 10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
//  1 --> [1]
function monkeyCount(n) {
    // your code here
      let arr=[];
      for(let i=1;i<=n;i++){
        arr.push(i)
      }
