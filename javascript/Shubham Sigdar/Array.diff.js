// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

// arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
// If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

// arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

function arrayDiff(a, b) {
    let result=a.filter(e=>b.indexOf(e)===-1);
    return result;
  }
  arrayDiff([1,2,3],[1,1,1,2])
